# hangman-game
A fun terminal-based Hangman game in C where players guess the names of popular websites. Words are encrypted and randomly selected. The game tracks wrong guesses, visually displays hangman progress, and validates input. Great for learning C concepts like strings, arrays, loops, and memory management.
